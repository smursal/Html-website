<h3>Perfect Sushi Rice</h3>
<p>Here is the recipe for the perfect sushi rice. You can eat this alone or roll into your favorite sushi roll with ingredients of choice.</p>

<p> I use strips of carrots, cucumbers and slices of avocado. You can the <em>amount</em> of vinegar in this recipe to suit your taste.</p>
</p>
<h4>Ingredients</h4>
<ul>

<li> tablespoon vegetable oil </li>
<li>¼ cup white sugar</li>

</ul>

    <li>Combine with water in a medium saucepan</li>
    <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for 20 minutes</li>
    <li>Rice should be tender and water should be absorbed. Cool until cool enough to handle</li>
    <li>In a small saucepan, combine the rice vinegar, oil, sugar and salt</li>

</ol>
